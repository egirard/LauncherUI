> OK we have switched over to main. Antigravity has designed docs/SLICK_TABLETOP_LAUNCHER_UI.md with visual inspiration and UX direction. Our job is to write docs/UI_OVERHAUL_DESIGN.md that describes how we'll take the current state of the launcher to the envisioned state. I suggest we use threlte for the graphics for the launcher, to be able to create the fluid experience described, but you can also argue for a simpler CSS animations approach if you think ou can render something like the given mockups with CSS. You'll need to split the sign in page from teh main page of the launcher, and in fact long term I'd like to eliminate the sign in page, but for now it is acceptable to have a sign in step that is reqiured before the main launcher screen appears. Let's make a PR for the implementation which for now may contain just the design document for what needs to be done.
