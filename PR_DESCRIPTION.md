# Slick Tabletop Launcher UI Design Proposal (Rev 2)

This PR adds a design proposal for the Tabletop Launcher UI, following the "Nano Banana" aesthetic.
**Update**: Focused strictly on the Launcher workflow (Selection & Initiation) based on feedback.

## Changes
- Updated `docs/SLICK_TABLETOP_LAUNCHER_UI.md`:
    - Removed "Game Session" and "Asset Gen".
    - Added "Grid View" and "Pre-Launch" flows.
- Added new concept mockups to `docs/images/`:
    - `launcher_orbit_selection.png` (Replaces home screen)
    - `launcher_library_grid.png` (New)
    - `launcher_game_details.png` (New)
    - Removed old images from doc (files remain in history or overwritten).

## User Request
> This is a launcher UI for a tabletop game system. Write a SLICK_TABLETOP_LAUNCHER_UI.md design proposal that outlines what the UX shoudl be like for a full size dining romo table touchscreen that plays board games, using image generation with nano banana for concept mockups and specifying user interactions with the interface. Follow WORKFLOW.md to make this into a PR and put it up on the repository.

## Feedback Addressed
> OK these design concepts look pretty good, but we are not designing what the game experience is, we need a detailed design for the launcher... Provide more mockups of the launcher screen with details on how the users find/navigate the UI to select a game and start it.
